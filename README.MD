# SabreTools.Serialization

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/SabreTools/SabreTools.Serialization/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SabreTools/SabreTools.Serialization/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml)

This library comprises of serializers that both read and write from files and streams to the dedicated models as well as convert to and from the common internal models. This library is partially used by the current parsing and writing code but none of the internal model serialization is used.

Find the link to the Nuget package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SabreTools.Serialization).

The following non-project libraries (or ports thereof) are used for file handling:

- [GrindCore.SharpCompress](https://github.com/Nanook/GrindCore.SharpCompress) - Common archive format extraction
- [StormLibSharp](https://github.com/robpaveza/stormlibsharp) - MoPaQ extraction [Unused in .NET Framework 2.0/3.5/4.0 and non-Windows builds due to Windows-specific libraries]

The following projects have influenced this library:

- [libmspack](https://github.com/kyz/libmspack) - Documentation around the MS-CAB format and associated compression methods.
- [Unshield](https://github.com/twogood/unshield/) - InstallShield CAB extraction tool that influenced internal handling

## InfoPrint

**InfoPrint** is a reference implementation for the deserialization and printing features of the library, packaged as a standalone executable for all supported platforms. It will attempt to detect and display information about many supported file types, optionally both hashing the file and outputting the information to a JSON file (.NET Core 3.1 and above only).

```text
InfoPrint <options> file|directory ...

Options:
-?, -h, --help           Display this help text
-d, --debug              Enable debug mode
-c, --hash               Output file hashes
-f, --file               Print to file only
-j, --json               Print info as JSON
```

## ExtractionTool

**ExtractionTool** is a reference implementation for the extraction features of the library, packaged as a standalone executable for all supported platforms. It will attempt to detect and extract many supported file types. See the table below for supported extraction functionality.

```text
ExtractionTool <options> file|directory ...

Options:
-?, -h, --help           Display this help text
-d, --debug              Enable debug mode
-o, --outdir [PATH]      Set output path for extraction (required)
```
